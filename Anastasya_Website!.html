                       Hey There!
                   <p> Welcome to my websiteðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
                   <br>My name is Anastasya Brodbeck. I am a mix race child, my father is Swiss and my mother is Indonesian-Chinese. I grew up in an environment with full adventures.</p>
                    
                   <p>What do you mean?</p>
                    --
                   <p>Well! I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia. It is the largest city in Indonesia, Jakarta lies on the northwest coast of Java at the mouth of the Ciliwuung, on Jakarta Bay.
                   <br>It is a consent buzzed where people seem to not sleep! You could get food that flavours explode in your mouth at any time and day when you want. 
                    Jakarta doesnâ€™t have a lot of public transportation available which affects the traffic, Jakarta is known for its traffic jam which can take hours!</p>
                     
                    <p>As I turned seven, my family and I moved to Singapore. Singapore is a city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, about 85 miles north of the Equator. 
                    <br>Singapore is a diverse country. (I guess all big city is very diverse.)
                    <br>The best thing about living in a diverse country and being mix is that you will not feel out of place as most of the people I met are also from aboard or mix like me!
                    My family and I lived in Singapore for ten years, did my primary and high school. I would consider Singapore as my home town as I practically lived through my childhood.</p>
                     
                    <p>After ten years, my family and I decided to move to the United Kingdom and settled in a town called Chester-Le-Street not far from Durham city. 
                    <br>I did my sixth form for two years. It was great exposure for me to learn the English culture. 
                    What I loved about my experienced there was I get to eat Sunday Roast every Sunday, really experience the Bondfire Night during a school camp and making lots of British friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have chosen to progress to the path of Hospitality.</p>
                    
                    <p>Which country can you guess has the best hospitality education?</p>
                    
                    <p>Switzerland!!! (Hope you guess that one right!)
                    <br>The university is located in a town called Montreux. They are known for the Jazz Festival. Funny enough, with the luck to be able to live in Montreux for three years but still did not have the opportunity to experience the Jazz Festival. 
                    I hope to experience it one of these days!
                    My friends, I hope my little adventure inspired you in some ways. I do not travel like I used to but hopefully, I will and this time with the path in my career in programming!!!</p>

                <h1>WHY</h1>
                <div class="paragraph" id="why-paragraph">Why Apply FAC.
                    <p>As technology progresses, coding becomes more valuable to the overall body knowledge.</p> 

                    <p>Seeing the progress from not knowing any codes to erudition on the fundamental of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Including creating a website!</p>

                    <p>It has allowed me to show my peers that you can achieve anything as long you put work into it, believe and do not be afraid to ask for help. </p>

                    <p>With the experience working in a fintech company, I have discovered an interest in a community called Women In Tech. </p>

                    <p>What is Women In Tech? </p>

                    <p>It's a community that brings women together to socialise and share experience in the tech industry. 
                       I am so glad to encounter such community as we are aware currently tech industry has disproportionately white, male and university-educated.</p>

                    <p>Not saying it's a bad thing, however, as a woman being surrounded just with men in the office can feel pretty intimidating. Or being a minority can feel less heard.</p>

                    <p>Henceforth, why it's inspiring and motivating to be able to be a  part of a community in changing the current scene in tech into a more diverse and opportunistic industry because it is!!!</p> 

                    <p>Due to the unfortunate case of the pandemic, it has lead me to unemployment. 
                       Nevertheless, it is also a blessing in disguise as I was introduced by my recruiter to Founders & Coders. It has opened up my doors to programming and new career goals.</p>

                    <p>Through my journey in completing the prerequisite and learning to code, I've experienced different types of coaching, myself included as a coach, 
                        I've experienced that coaching can be a pleasure and frustration.</p>

                    <p>FAC has introduced and encouraged Peer Learning techniques.</p>

                    <p>What is that?
                       "The term peer learning refers to situations where peers support each other in learning processes."</p>

                    <p>This technique of learning has taught me skills some of us might not be aware, capabilities such as leadership skill, patience, empathy, knowledge to code, clear communication with others. 
                        These are core skills that are important to have during our careers.</p>

                    <p>As one common mistake, I've seen in some developers or even the new developers is the lack of empathy when they coach someone. 
                        It's as if they've forgotten what it's like to learn from the very beginning.</p>

                    <p>With the gained knowledge, I've got from FAC and hoping to gain moreðŸ¤ž 
                       I intend to use the information to collaborate with others to expand mine and their knowledge of coding so that in future we can help those who are struggling or wanting to get into programming.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, hoping to create something that provides a positive social impact on technology.</p>

                    <p>Lastly, I would like to share a paragraph about ally that concluded everything in regards to my belief and goals I would like to become as an identity. 
                        Here, my friends, I hope it resonates, and you too! Would make some noise to make a movement in tech that provides positivity within the tech industry.</p>

                    <p>"Being an ally doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you fully understand what it feels like to be oppressed. It means youâ€™re taking on the struggle as your own.
                        A individual from an underinvested community cannot easily cast away the weight of their identity (or identities) shaped through oppression on a whim. 
                        They carry that weight every single day, for better or for worse. 
                        An ally understands that this is a weight that they, too, must be willing to carry and never put down."</p>
