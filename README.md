# My Application Website

This is my FAC21 application website to Founders and Coders.
Here is the [link](https://bran0392.github.io/FAC21-Application-Website/) to my website. The website is written entirely in HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
I have worked on my website together with my peer Chisha who is another applicant in the FAC.


Founders and Coders is a London-based, peer-led, social-impact-focused coding bootcamp, read all about it [here](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/)!
